# Excel_BikeSales_Analysis
Bike sales data often contain valuable insights that can guide business decisions and strategies. This project aims to provide a clear and actionable analysis of bike sales data, showcasing trends and patterns that can help optimize marketing efforts and inventory management.

## Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the data underwent a thorough cleaning process to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and format the data for analysis. Excel's data cleaning tools and functions were utilized to ensure data quality.

## Pivot Tables
Pivot tables were created to summarize and aggregate the cleaned data. These tables provide a concise overview of key metrics such as total sales, average sales, monthly sales trends, and more.

## Dashboard
The Excel dashboard was designed to visually represent the analyzed data. Interactive charts, graphs, and visualizations provide an intuitive way to explore the insights derived from the pivot tables. The dashboard allows users to filter data based on different parameters and provides a holistic view of the bike sales performance.
